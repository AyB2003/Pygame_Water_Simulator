# Water Simulator ðŸŒŠ

This project is a **water simulation** using **Python** and **Pygame**, leveraging **Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)** for realistic fluid dynamics. The simulator also incorporates the **Sweep and Prune** algorithm for optimization, ensuring efficient particle interaction calculations. This simulation provides an interactive and visually appealing representation of fluid behavior.

## Features

- **Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)**:
  - Simulates fluid dynamics with realistic particle interactions.
  - Models properties like pressure, density, and viscosity.

- **Sweep and Prune Optimization**:
  - Efficiently handles collision detection between particles.
  - Reduces computational complexity for real-time performance.

- **Interactive Visualization**:
  - Built with **Pygame** for graphical rendering.
  - Allows user interaction to add particles or adjust simulation parameters.
